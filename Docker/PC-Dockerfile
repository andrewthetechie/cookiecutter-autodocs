# This dockerfile is used to build andrewthetechie/cookiecutter-autodocs-pc
# It is for use with the pre-commit-hooks this repo serves
# It is based on distroless rather than scratch, resulting in a 1mb larger image
# This is due to how pre-commit hooks run as a non-root user interefering with how
# pyinstaller onefile executables extract to a /tmpdir.
# In the future, it would be awesome to go back to just one image based on scratch
